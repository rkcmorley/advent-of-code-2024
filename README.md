# Advent of Code 2024
This is a compilation of the algorithms I came up with without using AI. This is mostly done with anonymous Apex scripts.

<b>Two Lists to Compare, Subtract and Add</b><br />
two-lists-compare-and-subtract-and-add.apex<br />
This will sort the two separate lists then subtract each values from both of them then add them in a new list and add all the values together. 

<b>Alphabetical Mapping</b><br />
alphabetical-mapping.apex<br />
This will find a character or two in a string by extracting it from the map and then it will convert the integer (ASCII character) into a String character.
